**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What is (are) the purpose(s) of the structure?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> To house a composting toilet, a closet, and a handwashing station. To be a prototype for a single-room “nest” dwelling for a future build project. To make a statement that function can be fun! Demonstrate sustainability. Endure the test of time. Can be torn apart and reused or composted.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What is the footprint of the structure?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Needs to accommodate a “toilet stall” defined by the ADA for 60” wide and 59” long (about 5&#8242;x5&#8242;)<br /> </span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Where is the structure going to be?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Near the front parking lot</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What was there before the structure? (wetland, brownlands)</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Muddy, low spot that holds water 4 or 5 months of the year</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What type of zoning does the land have? Do we need a permit? Are there local ordinances that will need to be researched?</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Needs further research</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What is the timeline for the structure to be built/when is the building needed?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Project for the weeklong build at BRS in May</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What materials will be used? Are they new or used? What condition are they in?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Will be determined by the design.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Is there any readily available sand, clay, or stone on site? If not, can it be acquired locally? What about trees or lumber?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Clay and stone is available in the West Field. Tires are accessible. Lumber is to be re-used.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Who is responsible for acquiring the materials?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Jay and Persa</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What is the budget for the structure?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> <$1,000</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>What is the desired longevity for the structure?</strong><br /> 157 years</span>, per Jay

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Will the structure be designed for deconstruction or reuse? How much can be reused?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Must be designed for deconstruction, but won&#8217;t be easily deconstructed.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">How much of the work will the designer be responsible for? Will doors and windows be hung? Lime wash? Paint? Utilities? Plumbing?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Designer will be present for week-long build and following build sessions. Interns and volunteers will be recruited for some parts of the build.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Does landscaping affect the design and build (i.e. hillsides for passive-solar?)</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> The structure will have a living roof.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Also, the area is very wet. May need to contemplate a concrete pad and hiring someone to design swales to take care of the wet areas in the landscaping.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">If landscaping affects the design and build, will the property owner make arrangements for any necessary changes?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Property owner will take care of it</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Who else needs to be involved in the design and build? Electrician? Plumber? Carpenter?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> No one else, students will do the work and it is an educational process.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">How involved in the build will the owner be? (The more involved, the more they know about how it was built in order to better maintain the structure)</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Very involved in the workshops, site prep, maintenance</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Will the structure need access to utilities?<br /> </span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">No</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Will the structure need access to a sewage system? Will water be reused? Will rainwater be collected? (Location can affect these factors; i.e. factory downwind)</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> No, water-free</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">How is the drainage on the building site? How will roof runoff be dealt with?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Terrible; runoff will be handled with french drain</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What sort of foundation is appropriate and affordable for the structure?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Concrete pad</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Will the structure be heated? Will it use thermal mass or be passive solar? Does the interior temperature of the structure matter?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> No. Will use some thermal mass but the interior temperature does not really matter</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Are there any special feature requests for ease of using the structure?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Have the ceiling be high enough and strong enough to hold a living roof plus a few adults. Look at dimensional requirements for bathroom stall according to ADA.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">(</span>the minimum size for a wheelchair accessible toilet stall at 60 inches wide and 59 inches long, with the toilet fixture set in the corner of the stall opposite the door.)

</div>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Are there any special art features in consideration?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> The spire is an art feature, would like art incorporated into the whole building</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What tools does the build require? Who is responsible for the tools?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Determined by design; Jay owns all the tools<br /> </span>  
**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What type of energy is available at the job site? Generator? Extension cords</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">?</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> Near-by outlets?</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">All utilities are near the site</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Is there a building near-by for shelter if the weather turns during construction, or to safely store tools when not in use?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Yes</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What is access to the build site? Road for vehicles and trucks to bring in materials?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Road and parking access</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">How far from the build site will materials and tools be stored?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Not more than 400 meters away</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">I<strong>f a workshop for building the structure is to be organized, where will people stay? What will they eat? Where will they wash up and use the restroom? Where can information be presented to them?</strong><br /> Given; BRS has hosted builds before</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">If work is done during a workshop, what happens if the work isn&#8217;t completed?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Bits and pieces can be completed by other volunteers and interns</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What does the owner need to know once the structure is complete? Upkeep, maintenance, troubleshooting?</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> This is a question that will be answered throughout the time of the build </span>
