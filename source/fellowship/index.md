Last May, I participated in a week-long strawbale construction course at <a href="http://www.bluerockstation.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.bluerockstation.com']);" target="_blank">Blue Rock Station.</a>In September, I returned to assist with the weekend workshop and to refine some of my skills. At the end of the weekend, I approached Annie and Jay about helping them in the future, and through our conversation the first BRS Fellowship was born. During the next year I will be working with Annie and Jay on building an eco-friendly building to house their eco-friendly toilet. Join me on this journey by following my blog and Fellowship page updates!
