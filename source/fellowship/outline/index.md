> This is the Fellowship outline that Annie has put together for myself and future Fellows at Blue Rock Station. Requirements that are personalized for me are near the end of the document.

The purpose of the Fellowship program at Blue Rock Station is to offer an opportunity for people who want to learn the basics of sustainable living including creating buildings with re-used materials, the principles of thermal mass/passive solar, and using what’s available for construction.

The Fellow-ship project at Blue Rock Station offers a hands-on building experience with sustainable living techniques. Students will learn how to build a sustainable, independent small building – garden shed or cottage from the ground up. They will also learn the basics of food planning and preservation, along with animal husbandry techniques necessary to keep livestock healthy.

During an eight-week period, beginning in mid-May, students will begin working on a variety of projects to gain a baseline of experience to carry them into the week-long build (held the last week of May), and then into creating their own design for a project. The project may take the form of a structure, a system or something else…the sky is the limit until it all appears on paper.

**Persa Zula’s Fellowship – proposal**

Since Persa will be the “fellow” I am thinking we need to try to be good about following the guidelines I’ve outlined. Here’s what we discussed:

-A homework project to create a consultant questionnaire (to be used with us for the week long build 2012 project so she can gather ideas for designing the privy with a viewing deck)

-Create sketch up design for weeklong build in time for February OEFFA conference – include artistic accents (i.e. rounded staircase to lookout area, mosaic, etc.)

-Blog about the process during the fellowship

-Write a booklet at the end of the fellowship outlining “how to” build the project – a privy with a viewing deck on top

- Estimate hours for each step of the process – the privy will need to be built in about 4 or 5 days (finish plastering will need to be done at a later date once things are dry)

- Gain experience working with straw bale, tire foundations, sill plate (basic carpentry), each phase of earth plastering

- Create a mission statement for Persa’s fellowship
